## Sleeping and Measuring Execution Time

Write a C program that takes an integer `n` as command line parameter and sleeps for `n` seconds.
The execution time of the `sleep` function is measured and displayed as illustrated in the following examples of eecution and output:

```console
$ ./time 3
sleep duration: 3.000184401 seconds

$ ./time 5
sleep duration: 5.000073675 seconds
```

To check the correctness of your program, use a [suitable environment](https://github.com/essential-c/devcontainer) and write your solution in a file named **`time.c`**. In a terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```console
check50 03-mm-libc/07-time
```
