## Working with Pointers (2)

With a linked list\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list}}, the programmer uses pointer chains to link together data structures.
In the example program below, a simple linked list with 3 elements is constructed, then the value of the last element is printed on the standard output:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// typedef struct forward declaration for the pointer member
typedef struct s_list_member list_member;

typedef struct s_list_member {
    int value;
    list_member *next;
} list_member;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    list_member lm1, lm2, lm3;

    lm1.value = 1; lm1.next = &lm2;
    lm2.value = 2; lm2.next = &lm3;
    lm3.value = 3; lm3.next = 0x0;

    printf("third member value is: %d\n", lm3.value);

    return 0;
}
```

Modify the second parameter of the call to `printf` in order to print the value of the third element by using the first member `lm1` and following the pointer chain leading to the value of `lm3`. The expected output is:

```console
$ ./pointer2
third member value is: 3
```

To check the correctness of your program, use a [suitable environment](../../README.md) and write your solution in a file named **`pointer2.c`**. In a terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:

```console
$ check50 03-mm-libc/02-pointer2
```
